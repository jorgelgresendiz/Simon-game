# Simon-game

Simon is a fun interactive game that is suitable for all ages and also helps train short-term memory. 

## Motivators:
This game was built to practice my ongoing coding skills as well as for fun. Comments, criticism, and questions are encouraged as I am trying to grow and developer/engineer.

## User story:
As a user:

1. I want to be able to start the game when I want. 
2. The game should be set up in such a way that I can restart at any time. 
3. As I am going through the game the each button should shine at every stage. 
4. Additionally the level number should be displayed so I can keep track of my progress. 
5. The difficulty (number of buttons to be remembered) should increase as the levels progress. 
6. For an additional challenge each new level should be randomized so that I am not able to "cheat" and complete the game unfairly--I want to train my short-term memory! 
7. Finally, if I fail at any level, I want a message to be displayed to me that tells me I lost,and forces me to start from level 1. 
8. Alternatively, I would like to be congratulated if I successfully completed the whole game.
